      <h2>Have you ever spent half a day trying to find solutions for a problem?</h2>
      <p>
        Usually, when this happens, it's because you either don't know where to look or you need a better
        understanding of the underlying problem. I save clients time — sometimes even weeks or months —
        when trying to accomplish their blockchain or software related goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got in-depth experience with blockchain development, web scraping, data extraction, trading bots,
        technical writing and how-to videos. No matter what you're looking to do, I can provide value to your
        project and help save valuable time and resources.
